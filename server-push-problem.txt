# Server Push Problem & Fix Summary

## THE PROBLEM

Your local development server (localhost:5173) was showing features like the "CHANGE COIN" button, but your production server (Hetzner) wasn't showing them, even after Git deployments.

**Root Cause:**
- Your server serves files from TWO locations (in priority order):
  1. `public/` folder (takes priority)
  2. `dist/` folder (fallback)
- When you Git deploy, it runs `npm run build` which creates files in `dist/`
- BUT: The build was using stale/cached files, so your changes never made it to production
- Files in `public/` override `dist/`, but Git wasn't updating `public/` properly

## THE FIX

**We deployed directly to the `public/` folder to bypass the build process:**

1. **Fixed syntax errors:**
   - `game-main.js:635` - Changed `});` to `};` (wrong closing brace)
   - `update-client-state.js:327` - Fixed indentation and brace structure

2. **Fixed socket.io import issues:**
   - Changed from `<script>` tag to ES module import
   - Added `socket.io-client` to import map in `test-tubes.html`
   - Updated socket connection to detect dev vs production environments

3. **Direct deployment:**
   - Uploaded files directly to `/opt/flipnosis/app/public/` on server
   - Bypassed the build process entirely
   - Restarted the server

## FILES CHANGED

1. `public/test-tubes.html` - Added socket.io-client to import map
2. `public/js/core/socket-manager.js` - ES module import + connection logic
3. `public/js/game-main.js` - Syntax fix
4. `public/js/core/update-client-state.js` - Syntax fix
5. `vite.config.js` - Added proxy config (for dev only)

## KEY TAKEAWAY

Your server prioritizes `public/` folder over `dist/`. Either:
- Deploy directly to `public/` folder (what we did), OR
- Fix your Git post-receive hook to properly update `public/` after building to `dist/`

The direct upload worked because we updated the files that the server actually serves first.
