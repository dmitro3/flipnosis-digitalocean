# Core Game Modules

This folder contains the fundamental game infrastructure:

- **scene-setup.js** - Three.js scene, camera, renderer initialization
- **socket-manager.js** - Socket.io connection and event handling
- **game-state.js** - Game state management, save/load
- **animation-loop.js** - Main render loop and frame updates

These are the foundation that all other modules depend on.
