# Unified Game Architecture Implementation

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the unified game room architecture as prescribed by Claude Opus 4.1. The refactoring creates a single, cleaner game session component that handles all game phases efficiently while maintaining performance on mobile devices.

## Key Changes Implemented

### 1. Unified GameSession Component
**File:** `src/components/Game/GameSession.jsx`

- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adapts layout based on game phase and screen size
- **Spectator Mode**: Clear visual indicators for spectators with dedicated badge
- **Lock Animation**: Visual feedback when players are matched
- **Round Indicators**: Visual progress tracking for best-of-5 rounds

### 2. Unified Game State Hook
**File:** `src/components/Game/hooks/useUnifiedGameState.js`

- **Centralized State Management**: Single source of truth for all game state
- **Phase Management**: Clear state transitions between game phases
- **Timer Management**: Automatic handling of deposit and round timers
- **WebSocket Integration**: Unified message handling for all game events
- **Auto-Flip Logic**: Automatic choice selection when time runs out
- **Power System**: Integrated power charging and release mechanics

### 3. Optimized Coin Wrapper
**File:** `src/components/Game/OptimizedCoinWrapper.jsx`

- **Device Detection**: Automatically detects device capabilities
- **Performance Monitoring**: FPS tracking with automatic quality reduction
- **Fallback Rendering**: CSS animations for mobile/low-performance devices
- **Three.js Preservation**: Maintains custom coin skins for desktop
- **Streaming Support**: Server-side coin streaming during flips
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup and optimization

### 4. Player Card Component
**File:** `src/components/Game/PlayerCard.jsx`

- **Player Information Display**: Shows name, address, score, choice, and power
- **Active Player Highlighting**: Visual indicators for current turn
- **Power Bar Visualization**: Real-time power level display
- **Choice Display**: Shows player choices when revealed
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes

### 5. Server-Side WebSocket Handlers
**File:** `server/handlers/unifiedWebSocket.js`

- **Unified Room Management**: Single GameRoom class for all game phases
- **Automatic Timer Handling**: Server-side deposit and round timers
- **Coin Streaming**: Server-side coin flip animation streaming
- **Spectator Support**: Real-time spectator updates
- **Clean State Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management

### 6. Updated Routing
**File:** `src/Routes.jsx`

- **Simplified Routes**: Single route for all game sessions
- **Unified Component**: All game URLs now use GameSession component
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing URL structure

## Game Flow Architecture

### Phase 1: Waiting

- Game preparation phase

### Phase 4: Choosing
- Turn-based choice selection
- Power charging mechanics
- 30-second timer per round
- Spectators can watch

### Phase 5: Flipping
- Server-side coin streaming
- Fair flip determination
- Visual flip animation
- Power influence calculation

### Phase 6: Result
- Round winner announcement
- Score updates
- Round indicator updates
- 3-second delay before next round

### Phase 7: Completed
- Game winner announcement
- Claim winnings button
- Final score display
- Game completion state

## Performance Optimizations

### Mobile Optimizations
- **Background Video Disabled**: Performance improvement on mobile
- **CSS Fallback**: Automatic fallback to CSS animations
- **Reduced Coin Size**: Smaller coin on mobile devices
- **FPS Monitoring**: Automatic quality reduction on low FPS
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of Three.js scenes

### Desktop Optimizations
