# NFT Withdrawal Issue - Contract Ownership Problem

## Problem Summary
The NFT withdrawal function in the admin panel is failing with "contract interaction failed" in MetaMask because the contract ownership has not been transferred to your new wallet address.

## Root Cause
- **Old Admin Wallet**: `0x47d80671Bcb7Ec368ef4d3ca6E1C20173CCc9a28`
- **New Admin Wallet**: `0xDd6377919ef1Ad4baBBEAd667eFE3F6607558628`
- **Contract Address**: `0x6cB1E31F2A3df57A7265ED2eE26dcF8D02CE1B69`

The contract is currently owned by the old wallet address, but all admin functions (including NFT withdrawal functions) have the `onlyOwner` modifier from OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract. This means only the contract owner can call these functions.

## Admin Functions Affected
- `emergencyWithdrawNFT()`
- `directTransferNFT()`
- `directBatchTransferNFTs()`
- `adminBatchWithdrawNFTs()`
- `setPlatformFeePercent()`
- `setPlatformFeeReceiver()`
- `pause()`
- `unpause()`

## Solution
Transfer contract ownership from the old wallet to the new wallet.

## Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Check Current Ownership
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/check-owner-only.js --network base
```

This will show:
- Current contract owner
- Platform fee receiver
- Contract configuration

### Step 2: Transfer Ownership
**IMPORTANT**: You need to connect with the **old wallet** (the current owner) to transfer ownership.

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/transfer-ownership.js --network base
```

**Prerequisites**:
1. Connect your old wallet (`0x47d80671Bcb7Ec368ef4d3ca6E1C20173CCc9a28`) to MetaMask
2. Make sure the old wallet has enough ETH for gas fees
3. Set the `PRIVATE_KEY` environment variable to the old wallet's private key

### Step 3: Verify Transfer
After the transfer, run the check script again to confirm:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/check-owner-only.js --network base
```

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Use Old Wallet for Admin Functions
If you can't transfer ownership, you can still use the old wallet for admin functions:
1. Connect the old wallet to MetaMask
2. Access the admin panel
3. Perform NFT withdrawals

### Option 2: Redeploy Contract
If ownership transfer is not possible, you could redeploy the contract with the new wallet as the owner:
1. Deploy new contract with new wallet
2. Update contract address in the application
3. Migrate any existing data if needed

## Environment Setup
Make sure your `.env` file has the correct private key for the old wallet:

```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_old_wallet_private_key_here
```

## Verification
After ownership transfer, you should be able to:
1. Connect your new wallet to MetaMask
2. Access the admin panel
3. Successfully withdraw NFTs using the admin functions

## Files Created
- `scripts/check-owner-only.js` - Check current contract ownership
- `scripts/transfer-ownership.js` - Transfer ownership to new wallet
- `NFT_WITHDRAWAL_OWNERSHIP_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Expected Outcome
Once ownership is transferred to `0xDd6377919ef1Ad4baBBEAd667eFE3F6607558628`, the NFT withdrawal functions in the admin panel should work properly without any "contract interaction failed" errors.
